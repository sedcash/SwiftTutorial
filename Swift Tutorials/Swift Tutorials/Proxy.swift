// MARK: Proxy - Cloaks an object and postpones time-consuming operations until they are needed
/*
 Povides additional level of access: controlled, remote, delay
 -Delay creation: delay object creation until first access. Example laxy variables
 -Local placeholder for remote resources - Batch new work calls or return cached values
 -Protective - ensure caller has permission to access the method
 Avoid: Proxied type but not be exposed to client, client having access to proxy types
 lazy properties are not tread safe, because it can initlized many times
